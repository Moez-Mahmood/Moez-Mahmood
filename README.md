## About Me

> *Transforming complex IT challenges into elegant, automated solutions*

BSc Computing student at John Moores University with proven experience in enterprise IT infrastructure at Cambridge University. I blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving to build robust systems that drive efficiency and innovation.

When I'm not optimizing servers or automating workflows, you'll find me designing custom home lab environments, contributing to open-source projects, or exploring the latest in cloud technology.
